        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <p>
            The combo that brought post-hardcore to the Canadian mainstream, Alexisonfire formed in Saint Catharines, Ontario, in 2001. Vocalist 
            <br> George Pettit, guitarist/vocalists Dallas Green and Wade MacNeil, bassist Steele, and drummer Jesse Ingelevics debuted in 2002 
            <br> with a self-titled effort for the Toronto-based Distort imprint. The album did very well in Canada, garnering a lot of support for the
            <br>  band from MuchMusic video network. That exposure led to a distribution deal with the respected American hardcore and punk 
            <br> label Equal Vision, which then issued Alexisonfire's sophomore effort in June 2004. Watch Out! was even more ambitious than its 
            <br> predecessor, mixing moments of melodic grace with the wiry explosiveness that Alex had already trademarked. The next year, 
            <br> Ingelevics exited the group to be replaced by ex-Jersey drummer Jordan Hastings. A split with fellow countrymen Moneen appeared on 
            <br> Vagrant that November. Green also began working on some acoustic solo material, debuting the moniker City and Colour with 2005's Sometimes.
            <br> (Subsequent full-lengths by the project became even more popular than Alexisonfire's work.)
